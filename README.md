Here is application for tech-blog.

Template is from instructor Scott Brunswig who gave our class permission to use this setup as submission for homework.

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example it calls for the following dependencies --

    "bcrypt":
    "connect-session-sequelize"
    "dotenv"
    "express"
    "express-handlebars"
    "express-session"
    "mysql2"
    "sequelize" 
    
To install these dependencies I would type the following -- "npm i (name of dependency)".
Once that's finished you can begin running the application which is titled the following --"node server.js".

Also since this is deployed on Heroku make sure to install the following add-on -- JawsDB MySQL
Once that's installed, restart all dynos for changes to take effect.

This application is a basic site where you can sign-in/sign-out & also create your own topics & pages to save in
for your needs.

Thank your for your time & take care.
